# coevo 1.x - model of co-evolution of species

**Agent-Base Co-evolution Model started ~1995**

This was my first own simulation model. It was not published anywhere, but was used to obtain a government grant for young researchers that led to version 2. 

The history of this research is available in a project at Research Gate.

**Quick start**

It need __SYMSHELLLIGHT__ library in sister directory _SymShellLight/_ !

So go into your choice directory and run:

```console
  $ git clone https://github.com/borkowsk/SymShellLight.git
  $ git clone https://github.com/borkowsk/Coevo.git
```

Then go into _Coevo/_ directory and and run:

```console
  $ cmake .
  $ make
  $ ./coevo1
```
