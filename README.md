# coevo 1.x

**Agent-Base Co-evolution Model started ~1995**

This was my first own simulation model. It was not published anywhere, but was used to obtain a government grant for young researchers that led to version 2. The history of this research is available in a project at Research Gate.

**Quick start**

It need SYMSHELLLIGHT library in sister directory SymShellLight/ !

So go into your choice directory and run:

  __$ git clone https://github.com/borkowsk/SymShellLight.git

  __$ git clone https://github.com/borkowsk/Coevo.git

Then go into Coevo/ directory and and run:

  __$ cmake .

  __$ make

  __$ ./coevo1
