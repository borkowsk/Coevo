    "description": "This was my first own serious simulation model. It was not published anywhere, but was used to obtain a government grant for young researchers that led to version 2. and latter's. The code is written in very simple C ++ but it implements the main idea of the model. The next versions differed mainly in the increasingly complex visualization and complexity of the collected statistics.\n\nThe whole history of this research is available in a project at Research Gate.\n\n\"Macroevolution & coevolution in CA & network like models\"",
